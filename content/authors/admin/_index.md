I am an Associate Research Scientist at Lamont Dohery Earth Observatory. My research focuses on ocean dynamics, particularly on how the ocean transports heat and other tracers around the globe. I use a combination of theory, ocean models and scalable analysis tools in python. Recently I have been investgating the role of isopycnal mixing in ventilating the deep ocean, both today and at the Last Glacial Maximum.
